# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `hfjscli` is a command-line interface tool built with Node.js that provides upload and download functionality for files on the Hugging Face Hub. It leverages the @huggingface/hub library to interact with the Hugging Face ecosystem, offering a streamlined interface similar to the Python `hf` CLI tool but focused specifically on file operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload files to the Hugging Face Hub via command line, so that I can easily share my models, datasets, or other files with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `hfjscli upload <repo-id> <file-path>` THEN the system SHALL upload the specified file to the given repository
2. WHEN I provide authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub using those credentials
3. WHEN the upload is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with the file URL
4. WHEN the upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the failure reason
5. WHEN I specify a custom commit message with `--message` flag THEN the system SHALL use that message for the upload commit
6. WHEN I upload to a non-existent repository THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to download files from the Hugging Face Hub via command line, so that I can easily retrieve models, datasets, or other files for local use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `hfjscli download <repo-id> <file-path>` THEN the system SHALL download the specified file from the given repository
2. WHEN I specify a local destination with `--local-dir` flag THEN the system SHALL save the file to that location
3. WHEN no local destination is specified THEN the system SHALL save the file to the current working directory
4. WHEN the download is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with the local file path
5. WHEN the download fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the failure reason
6. WHEN the requested file does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, so that I can access private repositories and perform authenticated operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a token via `--token` flag THEN the system SHALL use that token for authentication
2. WHEN I have a token stored in environment variables THEN the system SHALL automatically use that token
3. WHEN no authentication is provided for public repositories THEN the system SHALL still allow read operations
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message about invalid credentials
5. WHEN I access a private repository without proper authentication THEN the system SHALL display an access denied error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear command-line help and usage information, so that I can understand how to use the tool effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `hfjscli --help` THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive usage information
2. WHEN I run `hfjscli upload --help` THEN the system SHALL display specific help for the upload command
3. WHEN I run `hfjscli download --help` THEN the system SHALL display specific help for the download command
4. WHEN I provide invalid arguments THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with usage hints
5. WHEN I run `hfjscli --version` THEN the system SHALL display the current version of the tool

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI tool to handle different repository types, so that I can work with both model and dataset repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify `--repo-type model` THEN the system SHALL treat the repository as a model repository
2. WHEN I specify `--repo-type dataset` THEN the system SHALL treat the repository as a dataset repository
3. WHEN no repo type is specified THEN the system SHALL default to model repository type
4. WHEN I use an invalid repo type THEN the system SHALL display an error message with valid options
5. WHEN operations are performed on the correct repo type THEN the system SHALL complete successfully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN file system errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with file paths
3. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL display a clear message about rate limiting
4. WHEN I enable verbose mode with `--verbose` flag THEN the system SHALL display detailed operation logs
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL display the error and suggest troubleshooting steps
